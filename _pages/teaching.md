In graduate school, I served as a Resident Tutor in [Mather House](https://mather.harvard.edu). [Resident tutors](https://dso.college.harvard.edu/become-proctor-or-tutor) at Harvard are graduate or post-doctoral students who live in the twelve Harvard dorms
and work closely with undergraduate students on their academic, professional, and personal development.
The mission of resident tutors is to help create a safe and inclusive environment where every student can
feel a sense of belonging.

I also served as a [Sophomore Advising Coordinator](https://advising.college.harvard.edu/sophomore-advising-0) in Mather House, Harvard College. I coordinated the advising process for 120 sophomores in Mather House, led training for 28 sophomore advisers (graduate students and faculty) in the house, served as a liaison between the Advising Programs Office and advisers, organized advising events and workshops, and consulted on the advising process with university officials.

I am an [ASEF Professor](https://www.asef.net/asef-professors/). The American Slovenian Education Foundation "enhances American and Slovenian education activities, uniting Slovenian scholars and educators globally."
